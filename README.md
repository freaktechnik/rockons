# Rock-ons

Rockstor Rock-ons that aren't quite production grade I built for my own deployment.

## How to use

As per [official docs](http://rockstor.com/docs/docker-based-rock-ons/overview.html#adding-your-own-rock-on) you can just copy the JSON files in this repo to `/opt/rockstor/rockons-metastore` on your Rockstor instance to have the definitions available.

## State

| rockon | usability | working |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| funkwhale | env config and user setup is a bit cumbersome| :heavy_check_mark: |
| gitea | easy - env vs. setup config a bit confusing | :heavy_check_mark: |
